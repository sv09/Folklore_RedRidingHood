            <p>A folktale typically evolves gradually over time, with new parts of the story added and others lost as it gets passed down from generation to generation.</p>
            <p>Researchers have examined the distribution of common plot elements within and across regions to make inferences about past migration, cross-cultural contact, and the impact of geographical distance and language barriers on cultural diffusion. It has been suggested that patterns of stability and changes in stories can furnish rich insights into universal and variable aspects of the human experience, and reveal how psychological, social and ecological processes interact with one another to shape cultural continuity and diversity.</p>
            <p>The chart shows how the story of 'Little Red Riding Hood' evolved and spread across different regions, based on the paper <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078871">'The Phylogeny of Little Red Riding Hood'</a> published by Dr.Jamshid J.

        <h3>Why did Red Riding Hood evolve twice?</h3>
        <p>The fact that Red Riding Hood <a href="https://www.livescience.com/convergent-evolution.html">evolved twice independently</a>, suggests that it holds a powerful appeal that attracts people's imaginations - perhaps to teach children to never talk to strangers, or to be vary of unassuming, and complacent people who try to charm them out on streets only to prove dangerous once they have the confidence of the innocent victims.</p>
